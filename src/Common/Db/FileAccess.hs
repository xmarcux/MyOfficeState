  Saves string to given file on a new line.
  If file or subdirectory does not exist,
  directory and/or file will be created.
  File is relative to execution directory
  and will be saved at: db/filename.ext

{-|
  Reads a newline separated file
  and returns an array of strings 
  where each string is a line in the file.
  File is relative to execution directory
  and must exist in subfolder "db".

  Deletes given string line from 
  file if it exists.
  File is relative to execution directory
  and must exist in subfolder "db".
