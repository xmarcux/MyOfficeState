  Parse string from client for supported services.
  If parsing fails ServiceError is returned,
  otherwise parse will continue.
  Supported services:

  newUser      - Client registers a new user at server. User string is supplied.
  updateUser   - Client wants to update its user information. User string is supplied.
  getUser      - Returns the requested user string. User nickname should be supplied as well.
  status       - Returns status for all registered users to client.
  updateStatus - Client updates its status. Status is supplied.
